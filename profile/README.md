With a vision to bring transparency and trust to the crypto markets, LumiShare has launched the world’s first Trust token, LUMI, which is backed up by 3 uncorrelated assets (Gold, Cash and Technology). 

The LUMI token is NOT a stable coin and its floor price will always be correlated with the all-time high market cap value making it a unique token with limited downside and unlimited upside.
LumiShare has also introduced the concept of “Proof of Transparency” including “Proof of Gold” and “Proof of Funds” in line with its vision of being 100% transparent to the world.

Their main business model is around the unique Assets Backed NFT Marketplace which aims to tokenize renewable energy assets. On one hand, this will give an opportunity to people to invest in clean and green NFTs and on the other hand it will serve as the alternative capital for energy producers to expand renewable power production. Lumishare is committed to sustainability and understands that sustainable practices contribute to the long-term success of the company. In accordance with UN SDG Goal 7, they will help produce affordable, clean energy all over the globe.
